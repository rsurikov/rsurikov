### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a [top rated startup consultant](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01446c5dc904a1e9d6) with more than 15 years experience in IT field. My main goal is to define the shortest and stress-free way to launch your product without incurring extra expenses.  I started my career as a developer, but at some point had an opportunity to work as a DevOps, a project and product manager, and a UX consultant. 

It allows me to look at the project from different angles and understand common problems inside and out. My unique experience includes working with startups on pre-seed and seed funding stages.  

I can:  

- Help to avoid making popular mistakes that 99 percent of all startups make and that become the common causes of failure 
- Define an MVP and help to develop it - remove all the unnecessary, leave only a catchy idea, wrap it up and make a high-quality presentation for the investors 
- Create technical documentation/detailed project specification 
- Advise on appropriate technologies, suggest ready-made solutions / Help choosing the most technologically advanced and cost-effective options 
- Ð¡onduct an audit of what you already have (architecture, code, solutions used, etc)  

CEO at [Ronas IT](https://www.ronasit.com) company.
